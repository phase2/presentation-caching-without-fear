<!--
Authenticated users is the first place where Drupal by default bails on caching. It assumes that pages generated for user A will have something different on them than pages generated for user B. Whether that is due to role differences, a you are logged in message, or other.

When thinking about caching and especially your invalidation strategy, it is important to consider the impacts this will have on your infrastructure. While caching in general will allow you to serve more requests with less work by your database and web server cache purges can result in a flood of requests that can overwhelm your infrastructure. Specifically this relates to using accelerators but has some general applicability even when using only Drupal's internal caching. Generally sites with a large amount of anonymous traffic can be highly cached (75%, 90%).

It is s also very important to ensure your client has the right expectations with respect to caching and what clears, otherwise you will field requests of the "When I'm logged in I can see my update but I can't when logged out"

Also consider whether clients can replace files or only generate new file names, if only replace you can use much longer lifetimes for static assets. You can use hook_file_update along with the purge and expire module to allow for long lifetimes when files can be replaced.

For sites which need authenticated users, edge side includes may be leveraged to allow the overall page to be cached but let elements which vary based on the user get generated each time.
